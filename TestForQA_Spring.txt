It was my pleasure to emeet you today, 

As part of the qualification process, we are giving a remote test to write a small exercise in Spring-boot.

Those who accomplished the exercise will be invited for an interview.

The exercise takes a few hours if you are familiar with the technologies, and a few days if not.

_____________________


The following is a job qualification exercise which requires knowledge in the following technologies:

- Java
- Spring boot
- Swagger
- REST API/JSON
- Docker
- Angular 

Need to write a spring-boot application with a REST controller, which expose a Swagger API catalog.

The application needs to expose the following APIs:


List of the inventory items list (item no, name, amount, inventory code)
Read item details (by item no)
Withdrawal quantity of a specific item from stock
Deposit quantity of a specific item to stock
Add item to stock
Delete an item from stock  
Data should be persisted on H2 DB using JPA.
Need to pack and run the application from docker.
Need to send a link to GitHub for source and docker hub for docker image
Need to return the exercise in a week.

Bonus points for creating Angular pages which enable to create/read/update and/delete the item. 

Try to finish above task even you don't know some of the things in 7 days.
For any questions ask google or contact me directly.

Good luck!
